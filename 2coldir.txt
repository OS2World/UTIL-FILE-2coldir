2coldir is a crude attempt to imitate for os/2 the MS-Dos ddir PD
program that is available on many BBS's. It is a modified version
of the LISTDIR program from Iabucci's book 'OS/2 programmers guide'.

Known deficiencies:

-   works correctly only for disks with 2048 Kb blocks to accomodate
    for screen size

-   no sorted directories

-   no space on disk left message


Feel free to modify, enhance and/or distribute as you like.
